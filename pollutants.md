# Pollutants

## What the EPA is mandated to think about air pollutants

“The Clean Air Act requires EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)  for six common air pollutants,” 
also know as ‘criteria pollutants’. They are: Ground-level Ozone, Particulate Matter, Carbon Monoxide, Lead, 
Sulfur Dioxide, Nitrogen Dioxide. In addition, the Clean Air Act also defines 187 Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPS) 
which are considered detrimental to either human health **or the environment**.

## Air Pollutants and Their Affect on Human Health

### HAPS That Show Up Above Government Mandated Levels

A study found that "concentrations of benzene, carbon tetrachloride, arsenic, 1,3-butathene, and acetaldehyde were 
above the 10^-6 cancer risk level at most sites nationally with a high degree of confidence." They also found that 
"concentrations of tetrachloroethylene, ethylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and 1,4-dkhlorobenzene were also often greater 
than the 10^-6 cancer risk level," but these molecules have less proven correlations with cancer.

### Synergies Between Pollutants

“We reviewed 36 laboratory studies of combinations of ozone with other pollutants that were reported in the recent U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency Ozone Criteria Document. We examined original reports to determine whether the 
experimental design tested for synergy and whether synergy was demonstrated. Fourteen studies demonstrated synergism, 
although synergistic, additive, and antagonistic effects were sometimes observed among different outcomes or at different 
times after exposure.”

## Techniques for Analyzing Pollutant Sensor Readings

### Cross Interference and Using Marker Molecules

All sensors have at least some of what is called "Cross Interference" between its target molecule and other molecules. 
With a multi-sensor system, it should be possible to normalize your readings if you pay close attention to each sensor's 
cross interference levels from the data sheet. It is also possible to use these cross interferences to infer molecules that 
the sensor isn't explicitly targetting. I'm not sure if these cross readings have the same accuracy guarantee as the target 
molecule.

### Dealing with the Method Detection Limit (MDL)

A sensor's Method Detection Limit (MDL) is the level of pollutant concentration below which the sensor will stop giving 
accurate readings. There are various ways to compensate for readings below the sensor's MDL when calculating averages 
over long periods of time. Some are complicated statistical techniques. One study just substituted all readings below 
the MDL with (MDL/2). The study made the claim that this resulted in averages that were reasonably close to those achieved 
with the more sophisticated methods of substitution.

## Indoor Health Effects

“4.3 million people a year die prematurely from illness attributable to the household air pollution caused by the 
inefficient use of solid fuels (2012 data) for cooking.”
